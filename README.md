# NU-WRF_Peatlands
This repository contains the following folders:

  - Literature
  
    This folder contains the namelist files and other wrf files obtained from literature together with the papers they originate from.
  - Code
  
    This folder contains the code which originated from an example case with noahmp36_modis_merra2. It is adapted to fit the changes needed for my MSc thesis and will be updated       regularly.
    
    This folder also contains the folder 'postproc' in which codes that are used to visualize the wrf output and other postprocessing scripts are stored.
    
    In the subfolder 'lightning', the script which is used to create a netCDF file of the lightning data is stored.
