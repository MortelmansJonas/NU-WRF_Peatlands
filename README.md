------------------
This is the repository for the MSc thesis of Jonas Mortelmans.
------------------

- The folder 'Literature' contains reference namelist files from other papers. 
  None of these files are adapted or used further in the process. They are merely used as examples for specific settings.

- 'notes_for_testcases.md' represent the earliest errors and the beginning of the process.
  Any adaptations made to the original script are only made to fix this and following errors.
  This does not count for adaptations for specific settings, such as domain size/location.

- The folder 'Code' contains all code used and produced in function of the thesis.
  The original source code of NU-WRF should still be obtained via the official way (NASA/github).
