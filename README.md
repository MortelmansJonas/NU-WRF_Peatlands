This is the repository for the MSc thesis of Jonas Mortelmans.

Notes (10/03/2021):

	- It is still under construction. Specific files will still be regularly updated.

	- The folder 'Literature' contains reference namelist files from other papers. 
	  None of these files are adapted or used further in the process. They are merely used as examples for specific settings.

	- 'notes_for_testcases.md' represent the earliest errors and the beginning of the process.
	  Any adaptations made to the original script are only made to fix this and following errors.
	  This does not count for adaptations for specific settings, such as domain size/location.

	- The folder 'Code' contains all adaptations to the original source code that are needed to run NU-WRF on the VSC HPC.
	  The original source code of NU-WRF should still be obtained via the official way (NASA/github).
	  Some notes:
		- All the files are considered to be the ones most up to date, however, they can still be updated.
		- In this folder, additional files are added for further postprocessing the wrf output and lightning observational data.
