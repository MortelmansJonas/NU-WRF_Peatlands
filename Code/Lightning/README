Notes (10/03/2021):

- 'Lightning_data_full.py' does multiple things:

	- It plots the amount of flashes per day and per type (CC and CG)
	- It plots the amount of flashes per day, per type and per location (latitudes and longitudes are rounded to 2 decimal places.)
	- It creates a netCDF file with, for each type separately, the flashedensity and the average Estimated Peak Current (EPC).
	
- 'Observations_data_diurnal.py' takes the average of each hour of the day and stores it in a netCDF file. This makes it possible to make diurnal plots (the script for this is in 'Postproc')
