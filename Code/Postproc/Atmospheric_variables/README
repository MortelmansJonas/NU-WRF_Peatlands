This folder contains all scripts used to plot the daily average precipitation, latent, and sensible heat flux for both the model (both resolutions) and the MERRA-2 data.

- 'WRF_output_2015_d01_MERRA2.py' and 'WRF_output_2015_d02_MERRA2.py' contain the script to extract the plotted variables from the hourly WRF files (d01 and d02, respectively).
  This is also done for all the other years, by executing the same script, but changing the year.
 
- 'd01_MERRA2.py' and 'd02_MERRA2.py' combine the data of all years and put them in 1 netcdf file.

- 'Daily_MERRA2.py' calculates the daily averages of the variables for both the model output and the MERRA-2 data.

- 'MERRA2_maps.py' is then used to plot the 6-year average of these daily averages for both the model and the MERRA-2 data.
