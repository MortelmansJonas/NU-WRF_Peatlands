Notes (10/03/2021):

- 'RUN_NU-WRF' contains all files that were adapted to run on VSC HPC, a list of the changes, a workflow to run NU-WRF, and the input files for the LDT, LIS and WRF modules of NU-WRF.

- 'Lightning' contains all files that are used to group the CLDN observational data per location and timestep.

- 'Postproc' contains all files that are needed to postprocess the wrf output, including the scripts to calculate/plot the different lightning indices. Due to confidentiality, the script used to calculate the LPI is not in this repository.

- 'Spin-up_control' contains files to check the spin-up performed with LIS.
