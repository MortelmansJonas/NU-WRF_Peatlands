NOAHMP-3.6 MERRA2 Forcing Testcase

This is a test case that uses:
  (a) CONUS NE quadrant domain (98W-68W, 34N-53N) with 1 nest (9km)
      Lambert projection
  (b) Simulation time period from 12Z 11 Jul 2015 to 12Z 12 Jul 2015
  (c) MODIS geographical data
  (d) Noah-3.6 LSM with MERRA2 forcing and budget-bilinear Interpolation
      with 4-day LIS spinup
  (e) Goddard MP (3ice) and Goddard 2014 radiation
  (f) Use MERRA2 MET data, daily average air temperature for small water
      bodies and SST for oceans and great lakes.
