- 'Lightning' contains all files that are used to process (store in netcdf file) and plot the observational lightning data.

- 'Postproc' contains all files that are needed to postprocess the wrf output, including RIP, UPP and the scripts to calculate/plot the different lightning schemes.

- 'Spin-up_control' contains files to check the spin-up performed with LIS and plots two variables to evaluate over time.
